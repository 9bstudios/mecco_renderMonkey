# RenderMonkey
**Rendering utilities for MODO**

RenderMonkey is a collection of rendering automation tools for MODO. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.

RM has several inter-related featuresets: easy progressive rendering, render range, combine pass groups, and batch rendering.

We wrote RM because we wanted to use it in our own work, and thought other people might want to use it too.

- **Simple progressive rendering** - maximum quality with minimum effort

- **Render range** - e.g. "1-5, 10, 20-15" renders frames [1,2,3,4,5,10,20,19,18,17,16,15]


- **Combine pass groups** - e.g. a scene with one pass group called 'shots' and another called 'colorways', render each shot for each colorway


- **Batch rendering** - Line 'em up and knock 'em down: set up all of your render jobs from all of your scene files and let The Monkey do the rest.
